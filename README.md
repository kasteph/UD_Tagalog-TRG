# UD_Tagalog

UD_Tagalog is a proof of concept treebank for Tagalog. This treebank uses the [CoNLL-U format](http://universaldependencies.org/format.html).

## Issues

- Voice dimension in Tagalog is quite complex (see [this wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austronesian_alignment)). A possible solution with annotating voice is found in the Unimorph Schema [pp. 57, 58].

- The word **ang** also possesses a lot of functions (see Reid's Determiners, Nouns, or What? paper) so annotating it is not so straightforward. Is it a root with sentences such as `schachter-otanes-0`?

- It is difficult to parse Tagalog with paradigms such as X-bar syntax (see Van Valin [pp. 1]) since it's most basic structure is considered to be a Basic Sentence consisting of two daughters: a Predicate and a Topic (see Schachter, Otanes [pp. 60]). The nucleus of such sentences are often markers such as **ang** or **ng**. When these nuclei are removed, the sentence becomes ungrammatical.

- How do I annotate XPOSTAG for particles?

- Do I mark Case feature on the particle or the noun?

- kita is ko-ka -> me-you. 

## Notes

`sent_id` format:

    [author_name]-[page_number|_]-[sentence-position-in-page]

where:

- `author_name` is the name of the author(s)

- `page_number` is the number of the page in the book or article (or an `_` otherwise)

- `sentence-position-in-page` a 0-indexed position of the sentence i.e. if there are 3 example sentences in one page, 0 would be the first example in that page.

- Voice annotations are from UniMorph schema:

    - AgentFoc is Agent Focus.

    - ConvFoc is Conveyed Focus.

- Person as Dual and Case as Abs for kita (absolutive dual) since it conveys from "I" to "you" in one word.
